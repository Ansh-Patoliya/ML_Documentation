# ml-documentation

This repo tracks all my personal notes, code snippets, and projects as I work my way through the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" book (2nd Edition) by Aur√©lien G√©ron.

## What's This About?

This is basically my digital notebook. I find that writing things down and coding along is the best way for me to learn. This repository is my single source of truth for all the concepts, experiments, and chapter exercises from the book.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Language

Just a heads-up: While this README and some folder names are in English (for general readability), **most of the internal notes, code comments, and documentation files (.md) are written in Gujlish** (a mix of Gujarati and English).

This is just my personal preference for note-taking, as it helps me grasp and remember the complex concepts better.

## How It's Organized

I'm trying to structure this repo logically, closely following the book's structure. You'll likely find:

* Folders corresponding to different parts or chapters of the book.
* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** These contain the actual code-alongs and my solutions to the exercises.
* **Markdown Files (.md):** My detailed notes, key takeaways, and explanations (in Gujlish).
* **Datasets/Utils:** Any supporting files needed for the notebooks.

## Status

This is an active **work in progress**! üöÄ

It will be updated regularly as I progress through the chapters. Don't expect everything to be perfect‚Äîit's a learning process, after all.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal learning project. It's not meant to be an authoritative guide or a replacement for the book (which is amazing). If you find these notes helpful in any way, that's great!
